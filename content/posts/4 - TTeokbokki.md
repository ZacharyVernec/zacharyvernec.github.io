Lunch! 

After a long, restful night, we are ready for some excitement. Let's skip the bibimbap for now (rice and vegetables... *boooriiing*) and go straight to the good stuff, [*TTeokbokki*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tteokbokki). 

The quintissential Korean street food, it has been a stable of JJ and me's pre-trip youtube hype sessions. It's a relatively simple dish, consisting of rice cake noodles (thick, unflavoured cylinders of rice flour dough) simmered in traditional Korean chili paste, *gochujang*, possibly sometimes with hints of fish cake broth.

Lucky for us, there is a restaurant specialized in tteokbokki a few blocks away, so we head out with little hesitation. 

However, once we get there...

Ah yes, the language barrier's younger cousin, the Language Hurdle™️. Well, some of these have stars next to their name, let's just pick the most expensive one. I think it's for two? We'll see if they complain. No issues ordering, let's see what we got:

Okay! This looks appropriately crazy. But our excitement was cut short as we realized that that's a melted slice of American cheese on top. And our first bite confirmed our suspicion: this is... an interesting taste. The broth, which gives flavour to the rice cakes and ramen noodles mixed in, is reminiscent of a onion soup, but with an added sweetness that does not play well with the very (mild) spice.

Mildly disappointing, but hey, it's an experience we wouldn't have anywhere else.
